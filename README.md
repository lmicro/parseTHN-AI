# parseTHN-AI
Notice: This is a rough draft of an unfinished but working product.

This is a python script that will not only parse the news articles from https://www.thehackernews, it will ask openai to make a simple analysis on the article to provide an easy summary with listed products and keywords.

I use this to keep abreast of some of the Information Security News out there.  

You must set your OPENAI_API_KEY in your shell before you execute this.
